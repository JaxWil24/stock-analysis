# Overview of Project

## We analyzed and organized the stock market data for 2017 and 2018 per Steve's request. To create easy and digestable material, we used VBA. Combing through the date, we combinded like tickers, inserted mathmatical equations, and color coding values for a quick understanding. This project was to see the difference between a shorter, more efficient code and the first code we created. We analyzed the difference between original code and the refactored.

# Results

## Refactoring the code helped determine if the effort was worth the outcome, and it was.

This is the run time of the original code.

This is the run time of the refactored code.
As we can see, refactoring it made it 0.41 seconds faster. 

# Summary

##Advantages and disadvanteges:

Refactoring code takes time and detail. It is important to comb through all the data to make sure you don't forget something and ruin the whole script. If it turns out, it will be an advantage by giving your computer more space to run it, giving others the oppertunity to see a more organized code, and preparing your script to be more useful in the future, especially code that you want to last.

##How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The old script had many subroutines that were broken up and conveluted. Refactoring it made the whole code more clear, not only to read but to run too. I would say the proof is in the time.
